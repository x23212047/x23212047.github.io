        <p>To whom it may concern,</p>

        <p>As a colleague-focused individual, I succeed at anticipating the needs of others and providing information that's both straightforward and easy to understand. I believe my skills and experience in IT Service Delivery can be utilised in future positions.</p>

        <p>During my time at Bentley Systems, I provided service delivery and infrastructure support for the Dublin HQ along with Lisbon, London, Milan, and Madrid. I coordinated with the Network team and Help Desk to further increase response times. I strive to provide the best service. During my time with Bentley Systems, we carried out an office move of 150 colleagues along with several servers and hardware for all colleagues. This was planned months in advance to provide the best and most efficient strategy. From this planning, I later went on to be awarded Bentley Systems colleague of the year for 2019.</p>

        <p>I enjoy gathering information and procedures and adapting them into relevant information that helps resolve end-users' questions. I also mentored new interns to ensure they were properly trained and gained valuable experience during their time.</p>

        <p>Thank you for your time. I look forward to hearing from you!</p>

        <p>Sincerely,</p>
        <p>Craig Jocelyn Oâ€™Hehir</p>
